Toys that help to learn tools and methods


## Some Trials

1. Classifying protein sequences to VFCID
    - Tips: we can initiallize the nn.Embedding layer with BLOSUM62 matrix

2. Classifying 16S RNA sequences to Archaea(0) or Bacteria(1)
    - Tips: embed nt with a vector of lengh 4, Conv1d to mimic the behaviors of kmers & also shorten the seq, do LSTM because the seqs are of different length. 

3. Load Structure data into Graph

4. A toy simulation try to recover community abundances from metagenomics data

5. AutoML for table data
